# Budget-Tracker 

# Summary: 
For this weeks assignment, we were asked to add functionality to the existing Budget Tracker app for offline access and functionality so when the app is offline, a user can still enter transactions and they will still be saved even after they app comes back online.

The final result was this: https://track-n-save.herokuapp.com/

# Installation:
- "npm i" to install necessary packages to run Budget Tracker
- "npm start" to run budget tracker on localhost

# Issues: 
One of the only issues that I had while creating the functionality of this app was getting any of my transactions to save offline, which was the whole point of this assignment. When I got the the offline feature to work, it would duplicate the transaction on the app after refreshing the app over and over again.
